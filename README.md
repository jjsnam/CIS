# A Comparative Study of Deep Learning and Traditional Models for Human Face Image Deepfake Detection

## Introduction

## Requirements

Our experiment was performed on a V100 GPU provided by [GPU Share](https://gpushare.com/).

## Datasets

All of our datasets originates from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Usage

use:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jjsnam/CIS
```

but not git clone since we previously added some weights to make the repository much bigger.
